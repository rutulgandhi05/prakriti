inference_prompt: A young adventurer in their late 20s with a medium build and an athletic physique, standing about 6 feet tall. The character has short, wavy chestnut-brown hair that falls slightly over their forehead, giving them a rugged yet approachable look. Their face is sharp and angular, with high cheekbones and a well-defined jawline, hinting at a life spent braving the elements. The character's skin is lightly tanned from their many travels, with a few faint scars on their forearms and a small one on their left eyebrow, adding to their seasoned appearance. They have deep-set, hazel eyes that are alert and curious, reflecting a sharp intellect and adventurous spirit. Their eyebrows are thick but well-kept, and their nose is straight with a slight bend from an old injury. The character is wearing a weathered leather tunic, reinforced with metal rivets on the shoulders, designed for both protection and mobility. Over the tunic, they wear a thick, dark green cloak with a hood, lined with fur at the edges to protect them from the elements. A leather belt with various pouches and a dagger sheath is strapped around their waist, and on their left side hangs a small, hand-stitched satchel. Their trousers are sturdy, dark brown fabric, tucked into worn leather boots that rise just below the knee, showing signs of years of use. Strapped to their back is a long wooden staff with intricate carvings, and they carry a small, metal-bound journal in their satchel, used to document their discoveries. Their overall appearance is that of a seasoned adventurer, practical and ready for anything, but with a sense of curiosity and a slight touch of mysticism.
